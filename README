## Contents
 - `multiphase_solver.py`: A Cantera-based zero-dimensional solver for gas/solid
   multi-phase systems. It now tracks gas and solid phases separately,
   enabling simulations of coupled chemistry such as pyrolysis.
- `MytestNew2/MytestNew3/sample3.C`: Example C program used for testing.

## Usage
```
python multiphase_solver.py GAS_MECH SOLID_MECH [END_TIME]
```
`GAS_MECH` and `SOLID_MECH` are the mechanism YAML or CTI files describing the
thermodynamic and kinetic data for each phase. The script prints the final state
of the gas and solid separately, which is useful for validating pyrolysis
mechanisms.
