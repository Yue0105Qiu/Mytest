## Contents
- `multiphase_solver.py`: A Cantera-based zero-dimensional solver for gas/solid
  multi-phase systems. It loads mechanism files for each phase and integrates the
  reactor network.
- `MytestNew2/MytestNew3/sample3.C`: Example C program used for testing.

## Usage
```
python multiphase_solver.py GAS_MECH SOLID_MECH [END_TIME]
```
`GAS_MECH` and `SOLID_MECH` are the mechanism YAML or CTI files describing the
thermodynamic and kinetic data for each phase.
